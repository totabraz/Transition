- Problem Statement:
  simulates displaying payment transaction data.
  The application should allow users to view a list of payment transactions and filter transactions by date range.

Requirements:

- Display a list of past transactions, each with a unique ID and an amount., use a promise that returns an array with the past transactions.
- Display a target amount input field that users can use to check if any two transactions add up to that target.

* After the user enters a target amount and clicks “Check Transactions”, display the indices (or IDs) of two transactions that add up to that target.
* If no two transactions add up to the target, display a message like “No matching transactions found.”

- Users should be able to add new transactions (ID and amount) to the list.

Bonus Points (Optional):

- Display any validation or error messages if necessary (e.g., for invalid inputs). (Bonus points)

Constraints:

- Third-party APIs are not allowed. You must use a mock API for data.
- You can use any libraries or packages you find suitable for this task.
- The application should be designed with best practices for performance, maintainability, and scalability in mind.
